Bonnie is designed to scale in two ways: A new Bonnie app can be created and deployed with tools provided to project managers, without the need of a developer. They are able to submit configurations, assets, and etc and receive an application. Bonnie is also designed with heavy dependency injection as a root design pattern. This allow development to scale with mass parallelization without dealing with conflicts. Along with a full fledged iOS Project written in Objective-C, there is a backend component written in NodeJS. There are currently over 50 variants of Bonnie in the Apple App Store. ",
